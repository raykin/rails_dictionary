      # Programmer DOC:
      #   There are two chooses to get subclass,one is subclasses the other is descendants,
      #   I don't know which is better,but descendants contains subclass of subclass,it contains more.
      #
      #   Class like +Ckeditor::Asset+ transfer to "ckeditor/asset",but we can not naming method like that,
      #   So it still not support, the solution may be simple,just make another convention to escape "/"
      #
      #   Seems this method did not need to be cached in production.
      #   Because everyclass was cached before application was run.So after application was run, it never be run again.

      #   To cache this method output need more skills on how to caculate ActiveRecord::Base.descendants
      #   Temply remove the cache
      #   And add test for this situation
